# Introduction
SQL Queries donâ€™t just access raw data, they can also perform calculations on the raw data to answer specific data questions.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called **aggregates**.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named `fake_apps` which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates:-                                      
* `COUNT()`: count the number of rows.
* `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column.
* `MAX()`/`MIN()`: the largest/smallest value.
* `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column.
* `ROUND()`: round the values in the column.

â†’ Letâ€™s get started!

**(1.)** Before getting started, take a look at the data in the fake_apps table.                    
In the code editor, type the following:                             
* What are the column names?
```SQL
SELECT * FROM fake_apps;
```

# Count
The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the `COUNT()` function.

`COUNT()`is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
```
Here, we want to count every row, so we pass `*` as an argument inside the parenthesis.

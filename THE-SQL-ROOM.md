# Introduction
SQL Queries donâ€™t just access raw data, they can also perform calculations on the raw data to answer specific data questions.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called **aggregates**.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named `fake_apps` which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates:-                                      
* `COUNT()`: count the number of rows.
* `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column.
* `MAX()`/`MIN()`: the largest/smallest value.
* `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column.
* `ROUND()`: round the values in the column.

â†’ Letâ€™s get started!

**(1.)** Before getting started, take a look at the data in the fake_apps table.                    
In the code editor, type the following:                             
* What are the column names?
```SQL
SELECT * FROM fake_apps;
```

# Count
The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the `COUNT()` function.

`COUNT()`is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
```
Here, we want to count every row, so we pass `*` as an argument inside the parenthesis.

**(1.)** Letâ€™s count how many apps are in the table.                                             
In the code editor, run:
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fake_apps;
```
### ðŸŸ©Output
```SQL
   COUNT(*)
-------------
    200
```
**(2.)** Add a `WHERE` clause in the previous query to count how many free apps are in the table.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;
```
### ðŸŸ©Output
```SQL
   COUNT(*)
-------------
    73
```
# Sum
SQL makes it easy to add all values in a particular column using `SUM()`.

`SUM()` is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

What is the total number of `downloads` for all of the apps combined?
```sql
SELECT SUM(downloads) FROM fake_apps;
```
* This adds all values in the downloads column.
### ðŸŸ©Output
```SQL
   SUM(downloads)
-------------------
     3322760
```
# Max / Min
The `MAX()` and `MIN()` functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have?
```sql
SELECT MAX(downloads) FROM fake_apps;
```
### ðŸŸ©Output
```SQL
  MAX(downloads)
-------------------
     31090
```
The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!

`MAX()` takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the `downloads` column.

`MIN()` works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.
```sql
**(1.)** What is the least number of times an app has been downloaded?
In the code editor, type:

**Hacker News** is a popular website run by Y Combinator. Itâ€™s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named `hacker_news` that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

* `title`: the title of the story
* `user`: the user who submitted the story
* `score`: the score of the story
* `timestamp`: the time of the story
* `url`: the link of the story

â†’ Letâ€™s get started!

**(1.)** Start by getting a feel for the `hacker_news` table!                           
Letâ€™s find the most popular Hacker News stories:

```sql
SELECT title, score

# Introduction

In order to efficiently store data, we often spread related information across multiple tables.

For instance, imagine that we‚Äôre running a magazine company where users can have different types of subscriptions to different products. Different subscriptions might have many different properties. Each customer would also have lots of associated information.

We could have one table with all of the following information:                                                        
* `order_id`
* `customer_id`
* `customer_name`
* `customer_address`
* `subscription_id`
* `subscription_description`
* `subscription_monthly_price`
* `subscription_length`
* `purchase_date`

However, a lot of this information would be repeated. If the same customer has multiple subscriptions, that customer‚Äôs name and address will be reported multiple times. If the same subscription type is ordered by multiple customers, then the subscription price and subscription description will be repeated. This will make our table big and unmanageable.

So instead, we can split our data into three tables:

1. `orders` would contain just the information necessary to describe what was ordered:

* `order_id`, `customer_id`, `subscription_id`, `purchase_date`

2. `subscriptions` would contain the information to describe each type of subscription:

* `subscription_id`, `description`, `price_per_month`, `subscription_length`

3. `customers` would contain the information for each customer:

* `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `address`

üìù In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn the `SQL commands` that will help us work with data that is stored in multiple tables.

**(1.)** Examine these tables by pasting the following code into the editor:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;

SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;
```

# Combining Tables Manually
Let‚Äôs return to our magazine company. Suppose we have the three tables described in the previous exercise ‚Äì shown in the browser on the right (we are going to try something new!):

* orders
* subscriptions
* customers

If we just look at the `orders` table, we can‚Äôt really tell what‚Äôs happened in each order. However, if we refer to the other tables, we can get a complete picture.

Let‚Äôs examine the order with an `order_id` of 2. It was purchased by the customer with a `customer_id` of 2.

To find out the customer‚Äôs name, we look at the `customers` table and look for the item with a `customer_id` value of 2. We can see that Customer 2‚Äôs name is ‚ÄòJane Doe‚Äô and that she lives at ‚Äò456 Park Ave‚Äô.

Doing this kind of matching is called **joining** two tables.

**(1.)** Using the tables displayed, what is the `description` of the magazine ordered in `order_id` 1?              
Type your answer on line 1 of the code editor (this is not a query).                                  
Be sure to capitalize it the same as in the table.

* First, we look at the `orders` table.                                      
* The order with an `order_id` of 1 is in the first row. Its `subscription_id` is 3.
* Then we look at the `subscriptions` table.
* The subscription with a `subscription_id` of 3 is in the third row. Its `description` is Sports Magazine.

```sql
Answer: Sports Magazine
```

**(2.)** Using the tables displayed, what is the `customer_name` of the customer in `order_id` 3?                  
Type your answer on line 2 of the code editor.                                 
Be sure to capitalize it the same as in the table.

# Combining Tables with SQL
Combining tables manually is time-consuming. Luckily, SQL gives us an easy sequence for this: it‚Äôs called a `JOIN`.

If we want to combine `orders` and `customers`, we would type:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```
‚Üí Let‚Äôs break down this command:

**1.** The first line selects all columns from our combined table. If we only want to select certain columns, we can specify which ones we want.

**2.** The second line specifies the first table that we want to look in, `orders`.

**3.** The third line uses `JOIN` to say that we want to combine information from `orders` with `customers`.

**4.** The fourth line tells us how to combine the two tables. We want to match `orders` table‚Äôs `customer_id` column with `customers` table‚Äôs `customer_id` column.

Because column names are often repeated across multiple tables, we use the syntax `table_name.column_name` to be sure that our requests for columns are unambiguous. In our example, we use this syntax in the `ON` statement, but we will also use it in the `SELECT` or any other statement where we refer to column names.

For example: Instead of selecting all the columns using `*`, if we only wanted to select `orders` table‚Äôs `order_id` column and `customers` table‚Äôs `customer_name` column, we could use the following query:
```sql
SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```
**(1.)** Join `orders` table and `subscriptions` table and select all columns.                    
Make sure to join on the `subscription_id` column.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;
```
### üü©Output
```sql
| order_id  | customer_id  | subscription_id  | purchase_date  | description       | price_per_month   | subscription_length  |

**(2.)** Don‚Äôt remove the previous query.                                                  
Add a second query after your first one that only selects rows from the join where `description` is equal to ‚ÄòFashion Magazine‚Äô.
```sql
-- Checkpoint 1

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

-- Checkpoint 2

SELECT *

  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id

üìù The `WHERE` clause goes after the `JOIN`!

# Inner Joins
Let‚Äôs revisit how we joined `orders` and `customers`. For every possible value of `customer_id` in `orders`, there was a corresponding row of `customers` with the same `customer_id`.

What if that wasn‚Äôt true?

* For instance, imagine that our `customers` table was out of date, and was missing any information on customer 11. If that customer had an order in `orders`, what would happen when we joined the tables?

* When we perform a simple `JOIN` (often called an inner join) our result only includes rows that match our `ON` condition.

* Consider the following animation, which illustrates an inner join of two tables on `table1.c2 = table2.c2`:

<img width="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be21eea-dd87-4c3e-b06b-35ca2b39ad5a" />
<img width="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6bb6f65-6d5d-448b-bd57-722a16a547a0" />
<img width="268" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/598adb1c-4162-4261-961c-368006cc6021" />

The first and last rows have matching values of `c2`. The middle rows do not match. The final result has all values from the first and last rows but does not include the non-matching middle row.

**(1.)** Suppose we are working for The Codecademy Times, a newspaper with two types of subscriptions:          
* print newspaper
* online articles

Some users subscribe to just the newspaper, some subscribe to just the online edition, and some subscribe to both.    
There is a `newspaper` table that contains information about the newspaper subscribers.                 
Count the number of subscribers who get a print newspaper using `COUNT()`.
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper;
```
### üü©Output
```SQL
  COUNT(*)
------------
    60
```
**(2.)** Don‚Äôt remove your previous query.                                  
There is also an `online` table that contains information about the online subscribers.                     
Count the number of subscribers who get an online newspaper using `COUNT()`.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM newspaper;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM online;
```
### üü©Output
```SQL
  COUNT(*)
------------
    60

 COUNT(*)
------------
    65
```
**(3.)** Don‚Äôt remove your previous queries.                            
Join `newspaper` table and `online` table on their `id` columns (the unique ID of the subscriber).              
How many rows are in this table?
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM newspaper;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM online;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM newspaper
JOIN online 
ON newspaper.id = online.id;
```
### üü©Output
```SQL
  COUNT(*)
------------
    60

 COUNT(*)
------------
    65

 COUNT(*)
------------
    50
```
# Left Joins
What if we want to combine two tables and keep some of the un-matched rows?

SQL lets us do this through a command called `LEFT JOIN`. A left join will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table.

Consider the following animation:

<img width="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62191e4b-000d-446c-81e6-4566bedfdfc4" />
<img width="268" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2afb0bc7-5965-46b7-9507-6bb3fb12a281" />
<img width="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd8c7526-abda-4363-af88-ac8ba439e8f6" />

The first and last rows have matching values of `c2`. The middle rows do not match. The final result will keep all rows of the first table but will omit the un-matched row from the second table.

This animation represents a table operation produced by the following command:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.c2 = table2.c2;
```
* The first line selects all columns from both tables.
* The second line selects `table1` (the ‚Äúleft‚Äù table).
* The third line performs a `LEFT JOIN` on `table2` (the ‚Äúright‚Äù table).
* The fourth line tells SQL how to perform the join (by looking for matching values in column `c2`).

**(1.)** Let‚Äôs return to our `newspaper` and `online` subscribers.                                  
Suppose we want to know how many users subscribe to the print newspaper, but not to the online.         
Start by performing a left join of `newspaper` table and `online` table on their `id` columns and selecting all columns.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LEFT JOIN online
  ON newspaper.id = online.id;
```
### üü©Output

In order to find which users do not subscribe to the online edition, we need to add a `WHERE` clause.                      
Add a second query after your first one that adds the following `WHERE` clause and condition:

This will select rows where there was no corresponding row from the `online` table.
```sql

# Primary Key vs Foreign Key
Let‚Äôs return to our example of the magazine subscriptions. Recall that we had three tables: `orders`, `subscriptions`, and `customers`.

Each of these tables has a column that uniquely identifies each row of that table:                  
* `order_id` for `orders`
* `subscription_id` for `subscriptions`
* `customer_id` for `customers`

These special columns are called **primary keys**.

# PRIMARY KEYS
The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is a fundamental database constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It serves as the main identifier for rows and ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate records and null values in the specified column or columns. It combines the functionality of both `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints, making it essential for maintaining data consistency and establishing relationships between tables.

`PRIMARY KEY` constraints are used extensively in database design for creating unique identifiers, establishing table relationships through foreign keys, enabling efficient data retrieval through automatic indexing, and maintaining referential integrity across related tables. They are commonly implemented in user management systems for unique user IDs, inventory systems for product identification, order processing systems for transaction tracking, and any scenario where each record must be uniquely identifiable and accessible.

Primary keys have a few requirements:

* None of the values can be `NULL`.                                                      
* Each value must be unique (i.e., you can‚Äôt have two customers with the same `customer_id` in the `customers` table).    
* A table can not have more than one primary key column.

Let‚Äôs reexamine the orders table:

Note that `customer_id` (the primary key for `customers`) and `subscription_id` (the primary key for `subscriptions`) both appear in this.

When the primary key for one table appears in a different table, it is called a **foreign key**.

So `customer_id` is a primary key when it appears in `customers`, but a `foreign key` when it appears in `orders`.

In this example, our primary keys all had somewhat descriptive names. Generally, the primary key will just be called `id`. Foreign keys will have more descriptive names.

Why is this important? The most common types of joins will be joining a foreign key from one table with the primary key from another table. For instance, when we join `orders` and `customers`, we join on `customer_id`, which is a foreign key in `orders` and the primary key in `customers`.

**(1.)** Suppose Columbia University has two tables in their database:

* The `classes` table contains information on the classes that the school offers. Its primary key is `id`.
* The `students` table contains information on all students in the school. Its primary key is `id`. It contains the foreign key `class_id`, which corresponds to the primary key of `classes`.
* Perform an inner join of `classes` and `students` using the primary and foreign keys described above, and select all the columns.
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM classes
JOIN students
  ON classes.id = students.class_id;
```

# Introduction

In order to efficiently store data, we often spread related information across multiple tables.

For instance, imagine that we‚Äôre running a magazine company where users can have different types of subscriptions to different products. Different subscriptions might have many different properties. Each customer would also have lots of associated information.

We could have one table with all of the following information:                                                        
* `order_id`
* `customer_id`
* `customer_name`
* `customer_address`
* `subscription_id`
* `subscription_description`
* `subscription_monthly_price`
* `subscription_length`
* `purchase_date`

However, a lot of this information would be repeated. If the same customer has multiple subscriptions, that customer‚Äôs name and address will be reported multiple times. If the same subscription type is ordered by multiple customers, then the subscription price and subscription description will be repeated. This will make our table big and unmanageable.

So instead, we can split our data into three tables:

1. `orders` would contain just the information necessary to describe what was ordered:

* `order_id`, `customer_id`, `subscription_id`, `purchase_date`

2. `subscriptions` would contain the information to describe each type of subscription:

* `subscription_id`, `description`, `price_per_month`, `subscription_length`

3. `customers` would contain the information for each customer:

* `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `address`

üìù In this lesson, we‚Äôll learn the `SQL commands` that will help us work with data that is stored in multiple tables.

**(1.)** Examine these tables by pasting the following code into the editor:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;

SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;
```
```SQL
 ‚Üí Orders Table
| order_id  | customer_id  | subscription_id  | purchase_date  |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- |
| 1         | 3            | 2                | 01-10-2017     |
| 2         | 2            | 4                | 01-09-2017     |
| 3         | 3            | 4                | 01-26-2017     |
| 4         | 9            | 9                | 01-04-2017     |
| 5         | 7            | 5                | 01-25-2017     |

‚Üí Subscriptions Table
| subscription_id  | description       | price_per_month   | subscription_length  |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| 1                | Politics Magazine | 10                | 12 months            |
| 2                | Politics Magazine | 11                | 6 months             |
| 3                | Politics Magazine | 12                | 3 months             |
| 4                | Fashion Magazine  | 15                | 12 months            |
| 5                | Fashion Magazine  | 17                | 6 months             |

‚Üí  Customers Table
| customer_id  | customer_name    | address          |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 1            | Allie Rahaim     | 123 Broadway     |
| 2            | Jacquline Diddle | 456 Park Ave.    |
| 3            | Lizabeth Letsche | 789 Main St.     |
| 4            | Jessia Butman    | 1 Columbus Ave.  |
| 5            | Inocencia Goyco  | 12 Amsterdam Ave |

# Combining Tables Manually
Let‚Äôs return to our magazine company. Suppose we have the three tables described in the previous exercise ‚Äì shown in the browser on the right (we are going to try something new!):

* orders
* subscriptions
* customers

If we just look at the `orders` table, we can‚Äôt really tell what‚Äôs happened in each order. However, if we refer to the other tables, we can get a complete picture.

Let‚Äôs examine the order with an `order_id` of 2. It was purchased by the customer with a `customer_id` of 2.

To find out the customer‚Äôs name, we look at the `customers` table and look for the item with a `customer_id` value of 2. We can see that Customer 2‚Äôs name is ‚ÄòJane Doe‚Äô and that she lives at ‚Äò456 Park Ave‚Äô.

Doing this kind of matching is called **joining** two tables.

**(1.)** Using the tables displayed, what is the `description` of the magazine ordered in `order_id` 1?              
Type your answer on line 1 of the code editor (this is not a query).                                  
Be sure to capitalize it the same as in the table.

* First, we look at the `orders` table.                                      
* The order with an `order_id` of 1 is in the first row. Its `subscription_id` is 3.
* Then we look at the `subscriptions` table.
* The subscription with a `subscription_id` of 3 is in the third row. Its `description` is Sports Magazine.

```sql
Answer: Sports Magazine
```

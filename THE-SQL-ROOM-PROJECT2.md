**Hacker News** is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It‚Äôs widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named `hacker_news` that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

* `title`: the title of the story
* `user`: the user who submitted the story
* `score`: the score of the story
* `timestamp`: the time of the story
* `url`: the link of the story

‚Üí Let‚Äôs get started!

**(1.)** Start by getting a feel for the `hacker_news` table!                           
Let‚Äôs find the most popular Hacker News stories:                           
* What are the top five stories with the highest `scores`?
```sql
SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
### üü©Output 
```sql
| title                                                                        | score |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Penny Arcade ‚Äì Surface Pro 3 update                                          | 517   |
| Hacking The Status Game                                                      | 309   |
| Postgres CLI with autocompletion and syntax highlighting                     | 304   |
| Stephen Fry hits out at ‚Äòinfantile‚Äô culture of trigger words and safe spaces | 282   |
| Reversal: Australian Govt picks ODF doc standard over Microsoft              | 191   |
```
üìù Using `LIMIT` caps the number of rows in the result.                
üìù It is a simple way to keep queries from taking too long to run if you are dealing with a big dataset.           
üìù `ORDER BY` simply sorts the `score` column.

# Hacker News Moderating

**(2.)** Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users `(1-9-90 Rule)`.                                
* Is this true of Hacker News?                          
* Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points?                   
* First, find the total `score` of all the stories.
```SQL
SELECT SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news;
```
### üü©Output 
```sql
+------------+
| SUM(score) |
+------------+
|    6366    |
+------------+
```
**(3.)** Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories.         
* Find the individual users who have gotten combined `scores` of more than 200, and their combined `scores`.           
* `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` are needed!
```SQL
SELECT user, SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
### üü©Output 
```SQL
+------------+------------+
|   user     | SUM(score) |
+------------+------------+
|  vxNsr     |    517     |
|  amirkhella|    309     |
|  dmmalam   |    304     |
|  metafunctor|   282     |
+------------+------------+
```
üìù `HAVING` does not support aliases in the same way that `ORDER BY` does, so use the full column name.

**(4.)** Then, we want to add these users‚Äô `scores` together and divide by the total to get the percentage.               
* Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. Like so:
```SQL
SELECT (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 6.0;
```
* So, is Hacker News dominated by these users?
```SQL
SELECT (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0;
```
### üü©Output 
```SQL
+----------------------------------+
| (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0 |
+----------------------------------+
|          0.221803                |
+----------------------------------+
```
* That is ‚âà 22%.
* These 4 users have a combined 22% of the total scores in the table. Jeez!

**(5.)** Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are **rickrolling** ‚Äî tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny **video** and claiming that it links to information about coding.                 
* The `url` of the video is:
* `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
* How many times has each offending user posted this link?
```SQL
SELECT user,
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```
### üü©Output 
```SQL
+---------------+-----------+
|     user      | COUNT(*)  |
+---------------+-----------+
| sonnynomnom   |     2     |
| scorpiosister |     1     |
+---------------+-----------+
```
**( 6.)** Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites.                  
* Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most:
* **GitHub**, **Medium**, or **New York** Times?
* First, we want to categorize each story based on their source.
* We can do this using a `CASE` statement:
```SQL
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   -- WHEN statement here
   -- WHEN statement here
   -- ELSE statement here
  END AS 'Source'
FROM hacker_news;
```
* Fill in the other `WHEN` statements and the `ELSE` statement.
```sql
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source'
FROM hacker_news;
```
### üü©Output 
```SQL
Source
------------
Other
Other
GitHub
Other
New York Times
Other
Medium
Other
```
üìù Note: If we want to be more accurate, we should use `url LIKE '%github%'` because some GitHub pages end with .io instead of .com.

**(7.)** Next, build on the previous query:                         
* Add a column for the number of stories from each URL using `COUNT()`.
* Also, `GROUP BY` the `CASE` statement.
* Remember that you can refer to a column in `GROUP BY` using a number.
```SQL
-- Which sites feed Hacker News?

SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;
```
### üü©Output 
```SQL
Source	        COUNT(*)
GitHub	        23
Medium	        12
New York Times	13
Other	        3952
```
# What's the best time to post a story?

**(8.)** Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but‚Ä¶      
* What‚Äôs the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?
* Before we get started, let‚Äôs run this query and take a look at the `timestamp` column:
```SQL
SELECT timestamp
FROM hacker_news
LIMIT 10;
```
### üü©Output 
```SQL
timestamp
2014-01-27T17:31:13Z
2011-10-23T18:46:40Z
2016-02-28T06:26:56Z
2014-08-12T22:13:10Z
2013-03-06T12:28:02Z
2011-04-16T21:04:23Z
2014-03-18T21:44:46Z
2012-11-19T11:54:38Z
2016-11-04T13:55:30Z
2016-07-02T22:54:47Z
```
* Notice that the values are formatted like:
`2018-05-08T12:30:00Z`

* If you ignore the T and Z, the format is:
 `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`

üìù The `T` is just the separator between the date and time. You can read it as an abbreviation for ‚ÄòTime‚Äô.         
üìù The `Z` stands for the Zero timezone, as it is offset by 0 from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).          
üìù If you don‚Äôt look at the `T` and `Z`, it is easier to see the pattern in the `timestamp` column.

  **(9.)**  SQLite comes with a `strftime()` function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.
  It takes two arguments:                                                                             
  `strftime(format, column)`                                                                 
  Let‚Äôs test this function out:
  ```SQL
SELECT timestamp,
   strftime('%H', timestamp)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;
```
### üü©Output 
```SQL
timestamp	          strftime('%H', timestamp)
2007-03-16T20:52:19Z	    20
2007-04-03T03:04:09Z	    03
2007-05-01T03:11:17Z	    03
2007-05-05T05:43:58Z	    05
2007-05-11T05:48:53Z	    05
2007-05-25T22:07:18Z	    22
2007-06-08T08:44:50Z	    08
2007-07-01T00:06:57Z	    00
2007-07-27T16:47:00Z	    16
2007-08-08T00:45:36Z	    00
2007-08-12T07:35:25Z	    07
2007-08-16T01:02:49Z	    01
2007-08-24T18:17:32Z	    18
2007-08-27T17:32:10Z	    17
2007-09-11T16:27:49Z	    16
2007-09-20T20:31:21Z	    20
2007-09-22T08:21:17Z	    08
2007-09-26T05:03:17Z	    05
2007-10-08T21:28:06Z	    21
```
What do you think this does? Open the hint if you‚Äôd like to learn more.

üìù This returns the hour, `HH`, of the `timestamp` column!

For `strftime(__, timestamp)`:

* `%Y` returns the year (YYYY)
* `%m` returns the month (01-12)
* `%d` returns the day of the month (1-31)
* `%H` returns 24-hour clock (00-23)
* `%M` returns the minute (00-59)
* `%S` returns the seconds (00-59)
* if `timestamp` format is `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.

**(10.)** Okay, now we understand how `strftime()` works. Let‚Äôs write a query that returns three columns:             
* The hours of the `timestamp`
* The average `score` for each hour
* The count of stories for each hour
```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp), 
   AVG(score),
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
### üü©Output

```
**(11.)** Let‚Äôs edit a few things in the previous query:                                    
Round the average `scores` `(ROUND())`.                                                 
Rename the columns to make it more readable `(AS)`.                             
Add a `WHERE` clause to filter out the `NULL` values in `timestamp`.                                       
Take a look at the result again:                                                   
What are the best hours to post a story on Hacker News?

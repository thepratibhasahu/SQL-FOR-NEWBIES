# Trends in Startups
Howdy! Itâ€™s your first day as a `TechCrunch` reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a `project.sqlite` file that contains a table called `startups`. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

**(1.)** Getting started, take a look at the startups table:                                  
How many columns are there?
```sql
SELECT * FROM startups;
```

**(3.)** We want to know the total value of all companies in this table.                         
Calculate this by getting the `SUM()` of the `valuation` column.

```
### ðŸŸ©Output
```SQL
   MAX(raised) 
-------------------
   11500000000
```
**(5.)** Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money `raised`, during â€˜Seedâ€™ stage.
```sql
SELECT MAX(raised) FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';
```

```SQL
   MAX(raised) 
-------------------
    1800000
```
**(6.)** In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

# Let's find out the valuations among different sectors:
**(7.)** Return the average valuation.
```sql
SELECT AVG(valuation) FROM startups;
```
### ðŸŸ©Output
```SQL
  AVG(valuation) 
-------------------
 15974685081.9672
```
**(8.)** Return the average valuation, in each category.
```sql
SELECT category, AVG(valuation) FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

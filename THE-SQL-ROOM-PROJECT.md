# Trends in Startups
Howdy! Itâ€™s your first day as a `TechCrunch` reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a `project.sqlite` file that contains a table called `startups`. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

**(1.)** Getting started, take a look at the startups table:                                  
How many columns are there?
```sql
SELECT * FROM startups;
```

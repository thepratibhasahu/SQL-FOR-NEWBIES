databases, regardless of size.

The SQL language is widely used today across web frameworks and database applications. Knowing SQL gives you the freedom to explore your data, and the power to make better decisions. By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.

# Types of Statements

SQL statements can be broadly grouped into four different classes, or sub-languages:

**Data Query Language (DQL):** Includes commands for performing queries on data within schema objects, retrieving some schema relation based on the query passed to it.

**SELECT:** retrieves data from the database.

**Data Definition Language (DDL):** Includes commands used to define the database schema. These commands are used to create and modify the structure of database objects.

**CREATE:** creates an object in the database.

**DROP:** deletes an object from the database.

**ALTER:** changes the definition of an existing object in the database.

**Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Includes commands used to modify the data stored in the database. Examples include:

**INSERT:** inserts new data into a database table.

**UPDATE:** alters data in a database table.

**DELETE:** removes data from a database table.

**Data Control Language (DCL):** Includes commands dealing with the controls and properties of the DBMS, such as rights and permissions to database objects.

**GRANT:** grants a user permissions on a database object.

**REVOKE:** removes a user’s permissions on a database object.

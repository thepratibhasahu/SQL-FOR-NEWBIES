# Introduction
In this lesson, we will be learning different SQL commands to query a single table in a database.

One of the core purposes of the SQL language is to retrieve information stored in a database. This is commonly referred to as querying. Queries allow us to communicate with the database by asking questions and returning a result set with data relevant to the question.                                    
We will be querying a database with one table named movies.                           

**(1.)** We should get acquainted with the `movies` table.               
In the editor, type the following:                          
```sql
SELECT * FROM movies;
```
* What are the column names?

 ‚Üí The columns are `id`, `name`, `genre`, `year`, and `imdb_rating`.
 ### üü© Output

# Select
Previously, we learned that `SELECT` is used every time you want to query data from a database and `*` means all columns.                                           
Suppose we are only interested in two of the columns. We can select individual columns by their names (separated by a comma):
```SQL
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM table_name;
```
* To make it easier to read, we moved `FROM` to another line.

üìù Line breaks don‚Äôt mean anything specific in SQL. We could write this entire query in one line, and it would run just fine.

**(1)** Let‚Äôs only select the `name` and `genre` columns of the table.                               
In the code editor, type the following.
```SQL
SELECT name, genre FROM movies;
```
### üü© Output
```SQL
name	                       genre
Avatar	                       action
Jurassic World	               action

Toy Story 3	               comedy

Ali Wong: Baby Cobra	          ‚àÖ
The Big Sick	               romance
Deadpool	                action
```
**2.** Now we want to include a third column.                                       
Edit your query so that it returns the `name`, `genre`, and `year` columns of the table.
```SQL
SELECT name, genre, year FROM movies;
```
### üü© Output
```SQL
name	                       genre         year
Avatar	                       action        2009
